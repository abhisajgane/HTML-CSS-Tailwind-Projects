        <p>Hello! I'm Abhi Sajgane, a passionate and enthusiastic front-end developer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recently graduated with a degree in BCA Science from Dr. Babasaheb Marathwada University Sambhajunagar, where I developed a keen interest in creating responsive and dynamic web applications.</p>
        <p>My journey into web development started during my university years when I took on various projects that required me to learn and implement different web technologies. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the web development process, from designing user interfaces to writing clean and efficient code.</p>
        <p>I am a quick learner and constantly strive to improve my skills by staying updated with the latest web development trends and technologies. My goal is to build visually appealing and highly functional websites that provide an excellent user experience.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and contributing to open-source communities. I believe in continuous learning and actively participate in online courses, webinars, and tech meetups to enhance my knowledge. Outside of coding, I love hiking, reading tech blogs, and experimenting with new cooking recipes.</p>
